# Phase 8 Week 3 Labeling Snapshot

This snapshot extends post-tuning strict-block quality tracking.

## Scope

- strict guardrail only: `frontend-mui-v7-guardrail`
- source sessions: post-tuning prefixes + `week3-*`

## Result

- strict block rows observed: 7
- labeled TP: 7
- labeled FP: 0
- strict-block precision: `7 / 7 = 1.00`

## Notes

- Week 3 added one new strict legacy sample (`week3-guard-legacy`) and it behaved as expected.
