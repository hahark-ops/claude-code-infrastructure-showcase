# Phase 8 Closure Report

Phase 8 weekly optimization reached the initial lock target and now transitions to maintenance mode.

## Closure Criteria

- default runtime profile locked (`OPENCODE_DEFAULT_PROFILE.md`)
- strict guardrail split validated across weekly checkpoints
- execute-mode canary validated on a real package root (`.claude/hooks`)
- operator playbook and handoff completed

## Final Rollout State

- Phase 1-8: completed
- Ongoing mode: weekly maintenance review only

## Maintenance Cadence

1. Keep weekly KPI snapshot updates
2. Promote execute scopes only with canary evidence
3. Re-open tuning only when KPI regressions are detected
